# Pokedex

So the Pokedex app uses sequelize, handlebars, etc., which allows users to see the pokemon that has been created for them when they create an account. Once the user
arrives at the homepage, they click the option to signup which will redirect them to another page where they can enter their name, email, and password so they,
can create an account. Once the account has been created, the user will be able to go to their profile page and see the 6 pokemon that has been automatically 
generated for them. The user will be able to see the name and descriptions of their pokemon. The pokemon that has been generated for them are from the original 
pokemon series.
